# Changes Made for Public Release

This document summarizes the changes made to make the AWS MCP Server repository generic and suitable for public use.

## Files Modified

### 1. `docker-compose.yml`
**Changes:**
- Made Docker network configurable via `${DOCKER_NETWORK:-default}` environment variable
- Added comments for external port access option
- Provided examples for different network configurations
- Removed hardcoded `run_lbnet` network reference

**Before:**
```yaml
networks:
  - run_lbnet
# No external ports exposed - only accessible within Docker network
```

**After:**
```yaml
networks:
  - ${DOCKER_NETWORK:-default}
# Expose port internally to Docker network only
# For external access, uncomment the ports section below
# ports:
#   - "3000:3000"  # Uncomment for external access
```

### 2. `README.md`
**Changes:**
- Complete rewrite for public audience
- Added multiple deployment scenarios (standalone, n8n integration, microservices, etc.)
- Included comprehensive environment variable documentation
- Added security considerations and best practices
- Provided integration examples for different use cases
- Added troubleshooting section

**Key Sections Added:**
- Quick Start guide
- Deployment Options (3 different scenarios)
- Environment Variables with multiple credential options

- API Usage examples
- Integration examples (n8n, custom apps, CI/CD)
- Security considerations
- Development and contributing guidelines

### 3. `DEPLOYMENT.md` (New File)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive deployment guide with specific examples

**Contents:**
- 6 different deployment scenarios with complete examples
- Network configuration examples
- Security best practices
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Troubleshooting common issues

**Scenarios Covered:**
1. Standalone Development Setup
2. n8n Integration
3. Microservices Architecture
4. Production with Reverse Proxy
5. Kubernetes Deployment
6. CI/CD Integration

### 4. `CONTRIBUTING.md` (New File)
**Purpose:** Guide for contributors to the open-source project

**Contents:**
- Development workflow
- Adding new AWS tools
- Code style guidelines
- Submitting changes process
- Documentation requirements
- Security considerations

### 5. `.env.example` (New File)
**Purpose:** Template for environment configuration

**Contents:**
- Required AWS credentials
- Optional configuration options
- Examples for different deployment scenarios
- Comments explaining each variable

### 6. `SETUP-ORIGINAL.md` (Renamed)
**Changes:**
- Renamed from `SETUP.md` to preserve original server-specific documentation
- Keeps the original n8n integration instructions for reference

## Key Improvements for Public Use

### 1. **Flexibility**
- Configurable Docker networks instead of hardcoded values
- Multiple deployment options documented
- Environment-based configuration

### 2. **Documentation**
- Comprehensive README with multiple use cases
- Detailed deployment guide with examples
- Contributing guidelines for open-source development

### 3. **Security**
- IAM role recommendations over access keys
- Network isolation examples
- Security best practices documented

### 4. **Usability**
- Quick start guide for immediate use
- Multiple integration examples
- Troubleshooting section

### 5. **Maintainability**
- Contributing guidelines
- Code style standards
- Development workflow documentation

## Deployment Scenarios Now Supported

1. **Standalone Development** - Direct external access for testing
2. **Container Integration** - Internal network access for service-to-service communication
3. **Microservices Architecture** - Part of larger containerized applications
4. **Production Deployment** - With reverse proxy and SSL termination
5. **Kubernetes** - Cloud-native deployment
6. **CI/CD Integration** - Automated testing and deployment

## Environment Variables

The repository now supports flexible configuration through environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS credentials
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS credentials  
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` - AWS region
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` - For temporary credentials
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `DOCKER_NETWORK` - Custom Docker network name

## Network Configuration

Instead of hardcoded network names, the system now supports:
- Default Docker network (automatic)
- Custom network names via environment variable
- External network integration
- Multiple environment configurations

## What Was Removed/Generalized

1. **Hardcoded network name** (`run_lbnet`) → configurable via environment
2. **Server-specific setup instructions** → moved to separate file
3. **Single deployment scenario** → multiple documented scenarios
4. **Basic documentation** → comprehensive guides

## Ready for Public Release

The repository is now ready for public release with:
- ✅ Generic configuration options
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Multiple deployment scenarios
- ✅ Contributing guidelines
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ Example configurations
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides

Users can now easily adapt the AWS MCP Server to their specific needs while following best practices for security and deployment.
